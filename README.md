Retina Sprites for Compass
==========================

Allow to use sprites in retina with Compass.

##The problem:
You want your site to serve retina images to retina displays, but not to non-retina ones. This mixin / solution will
make it very easy for you to use sprites and lets Compass generate the mappings of the two different sizes.
